<p>Rev. Pastor Jeffrey Graves is the co-founder of Hope Dealer Ministries. After years of struggling with addiction and the subsequent criminal behavior that comes with it, Pastor Jeff found Christ while serving time in prison. Upon his surrender to Christ, Pastor Jeff was called into the ministry. He went on to graduate from seminary with highest honors and is currently finishing up a Masters in Christian Counseling and pursuing his Ph.D. Along with his brother in Christ, Billy Soden, Hope Dealer's co-founder, Pastor Jeff has developed a lifestyle formula for overcoming the obstacles and adversities of the world today. Through these Hope Dealer principles, and a heart for outreach, Pastor Jeff has dedicated his life to helping others restore their lives and to overcome the obstacles that life brings forth and to establish a method for victorious living, mind, body, and soul.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b615a0c71fa6fe5cb4594d62e8fef31e5b0b9706.jpg" alt="" title=""><p>Born in Los Angeles, California, Billy Soden grew up in a large blended family in the Minneapolis/St. Paul metro area. Billy graduated with honors with a degree in Music Education from St. Cloud State University in 1991, and received his Educational Leadership and Administrative licensure in 2013. As a former teacher, Director of Community Education, and Business Entrepreneur, Billy is a strong supporter of lifelong learning and has a passion for engaging in issues of civil rights and advocacy for the oppressed. Upon giving his his life to Christ, Billy has partnered with his best friend and brother, Rev. Pastor Jeffrey Graves, to begin the development of Hope Dealer - a non-profit Christian organization whose goal is to help others restore their lives and transform their feelings of lost hope in word and action. Billy and Rev. Pastor Jeff are currently co-writing a book titled “Hope Dealer," which will provide an inspiring message of hope and direction through a series of “Hope Dealer Principles." Hopelessness is curable, and Billy has redefined his purpose in life to help others recover lost hope acquired through any of life’s struggles, and lead them to a place of peace, love, joy, and eternal salvation.</p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="35"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="36"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="37"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="38"><span data-reactid="39"><!-- react-empty: 40 --><h2 data-reactid="41"><a data-reactid="42">Hope Dealer</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="43"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="44"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="45"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="46"></div></section></div></div>
