"Hope Dealer" exists to love others, help those in need through proactive effort and positive, inspiring messages of hope.

Rev. Pastor Jeffrey Graves is the co-founder of Hope Dealer Ministries. After years of struggling with addiction and the subsequent criminal behavior that comes with it, Pastor Jeff found Christ while serving time in prison. Upon his surrender to Christ, Pastor Jeff was called into the ministry. He went on to graduate from seminary with highest honors and is currently finishing up a Masters in Christian Counseling and pursuing his Ph.D. Along with his brother in Christ, Billy Soden, Hope Dealer's co-founder, Pastor Jeff has developed a lifestyle formula for overcoming the obstacles and adversities of the world today. Through these Hope Dealer principles, and a heart for outreach, Pastor Jeff has dedicated his life to helping others restore their lives and to overcome the obstacles that life brings forth and to establish a method for victorious living, mind, body, and soul.
