**Growing Faith**

Our faith in God does not grow without careful attention. Like the vegetables in your garden, your faith needs deliberate care. A bodybuilder cannot lie in bed and dream of growing strong and thus develop his muscles. Neither can we leave our faith on the shelf and expect it to grow.

God does not ask us to work the "muscle" of faith on our own. The father of the demon-possessed boy who brought his son to Christ Jesus said, "I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!" (Mark 9:24). What a beautiful thing to tell the Lord! God does not expect us to mature alone but commands a few things that will aid in the development of our faith.

Read over the list below. Where do you stand? What steps can you take to develop your faith muscle?

1\. Experience fellowship with other believers (Heb. 10:25) so that you can sharpen each others faith on the greater maturity. Commit to a church home and get involved with a Bible study, Sunday school class, or ministry. You cannot grow alone!  
2\. Commit to reading and studying God's word to know him better. David says in Psalm 119:11: "I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you."  
3\. Choose to pray for a particular person, situation, or even a country. Praying for others will not only increase your faith but also increase your love for people. God loves to answers the prayers of His children!

With Love,   ~ Pastor Jeff
