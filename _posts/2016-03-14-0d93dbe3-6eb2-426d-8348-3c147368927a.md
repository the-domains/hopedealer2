**Beauty, Ugly, and Demons** by Billy Soden

"Upon a
day Beauty and Ugliness met on the shore of a sea. And they said to one
another, "Let us bathe in the sea." Then they disrobed and swam in
the waters. And after a while Ugliness came back to shore and garmented himself
with the garments of Beauty and walked his way. And Beauty too came out of the
sea, and found not her raiment, and she was too shy to be naked, therefore she
dressed herself with the raiment of Ugliness. And Beauty walked her way. And to
this very day men and women mistake the one for the other. Yet some there are
who have beheld the face of Beauty, and they know her notwithstanding her
garments. And some there be who know the face of Ugliness, and the cloth
conceals him not from their eyes." ~ Kahlil Gibran

I have read
this quote by Khalil Gibran more than a hundred times, I'm sure. I even wrote a song
inspired by it once, My feelings on Gibran's words have evolved over the years. Initially, it was simply a story
about trust, the moral being true beauty is often mistaken for ugliness, and
vice versa. How many people have a story about a relationship ended that would
echo that sentiment? Many, I'm guessing.

But in the
context of spiritual faith, I think this story is really more about demons. Demons in the
biblical stories freak me out. Given our evolution of mental health
identification and the advancement in our understanding and treatment
of what may have been labeled as "demonic behavior" in a different time in
history, it's seems reasonable to make that leap. Stay with me here -- maybe it's that self-dysfunction, anxiety, that wanting not to be alone, that is an actual act of evil who purposely sabotages our lives, tempting us to view ugly as beauty, or beauty as ugly (not just in the physical sense). What if that were a real "thing?" If so, then I think it would be a safe bet to say that these "demons" in our lives are meant to maliciously keep us from being reminded of how loved we are, how we are children of God, and whose purpose is to lead us astray and remain isolated. These illnesses, addictions, hang-ups, etc...  are demons. They are fire-breathing dragons that will impose them self upon you in your most vulnerable moments.  They can leave you feeling hopeless at times. But know that you are not alone in battle...ever.  God's got your back, so let God fight your demons.  You, just concentrate on being happy and making great choices in life.  Between the two of you, you are empowered with grace that fuels your courage - and make you an unstoppable dragon-slaying duo!  No fear, my friends -  "...Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go." Joshua 1:9 the  Expend your energy by talking to God, and true beauty will be seen in the reflection of His love for you - and the demons can take a long walk off a short bridge.   With Love, Peace, and Hope, ~ Billy \#â€Žhopedealer
