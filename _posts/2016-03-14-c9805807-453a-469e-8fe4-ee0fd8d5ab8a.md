**Bring Down Your Goliath**

I come in the name of the Lord.

To bring down the "Goliath" in your life, here are three things you must do: (1) You must stand up to him! Any problem you try to excuse or escape, you empower. After listening to Goliath's threats every day, fear gripped the hearts of God's people and they couldn't stand up to him. (2) You must remember what God has already done for you. David recalled his victories over the lion and the bear. And you must do the same. Jeremiah said, "This I call to mind... therefore I have hope: because of the Lord's great love we are not consumed, for his compassions never fail. They are new every morning" (La. 3:21-23 NIV). The strength to deal with today's struggles comes from remembering how God helped you solve yesterday's struggles. (3) You must cut off the giant's head. "David... took his sword... and cut off his head... And when the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled" (1 Sam. 17:51 NKJV). You need to know your enemy, study his tactics, and be willing to fight with the same level of intensity as he does. You must take what you learn and apply it to his weak areas. And never assume he's dead when he's just dazed . If you don't cut off his head he'll sneak up on you another day. Go for a permanent solution, not a short- term fix. Fortify yourself with prayer, renew your mind with the Word of God, and reach for the support that's available to you through your spiritual family. Above all, remember your strength doesn't lie in yourself, but in God. With Him on your side you'll win every time! Keep fighting the good fight! Faith, Hope, and Love ~ Pastor Jeff \#‎defyexpectations
